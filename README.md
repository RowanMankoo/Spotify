# Spotify

The data set worked with in this group project has been obtained by merging data collected from Spotify and the Official Charts
Company (which keeps records of the “charts”, lists of the best selling albums, in the UK).There has been 35 albums selected from each decade from the 1960s to the 2010s. From
Spotify, we obtained: the album’s release date and a measure of its popularity; the artist that recorded the album,
a description of the genres of music associated with that artist, and a measure of the artist’s popularity; a number
of descriptive variables relating to each track. From the Official
Charts Company, we obtained the maximum chart position of each album (if it reached the top 100 albums), the
number of weeks the album was in the top 100, and the number of weeks the album was at the top of the charts.

We set out this project with two main goals:

1. To predict what type of music will be popular, in order to help the company invest in artists that will help
them make a profit.
2. To produce a system for recommending new music based on the tastes of a listener.
